# Storytelling AI Project

## Overview

This project creates interactive storytelling experiences for children using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a user-friendly interface. It combines various technologies to generate unique stories, process language, and provide engaging interactions.

## Key Components

### 1. Data Processing

- **NLTK for Lemmatization & Tokenization**: The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is used to preprocess text data. Lemmatization reduces words to their base forms, while tokenization breaks down the text into manageable pieces for further processing.

### 2. Story Generation

- **Fine-tuned GPT-2 Model**: We use the GPT-2 model (GPT2LMHeadModel) fine-tuned specifically for storytelling. This model generates creative and contextually relevant stories based on given prompts.

### 3. Interactive User Interface

- **Streamlit UI**: The project features a Streamlit-based user interface, designed with HTML and CSS to be child-friendly. It includes interactive buttons that allow users to choose genres and customize their storytelling experience.

### 4. Text-to-Speech Integration

- **GTTS for Narration**: The Google Text-to-Speech (GTTS) library is integrated to convert the generated text into speech. This feature enables the narration of stories, enhancing the interactive experience.


## Usage

- Launch the Streamlit application to access the storytelling interface.
- Select a genre and interact with the application to generate and listen to stories.
- Use the buttons to customize the storytelling experience according to your preferences.
